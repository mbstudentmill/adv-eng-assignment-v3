**Advanced Data Engineering Assignment**  
**Date**: August 10, 2025  
**Student**: [Anonymous]  
**Word Count**: ~1,650 words  

## Executive Summary

For Task 2, I developed a data warehouse solution using Google BigQuery with a star schema design. My approach focused on implementing dimensional modeling principles, performance optimization through partitioning and clustering, and ensuring data integrity through constraints and validation. The goal was to create a scalable foundation for analytical workloads while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with the data pipeline from Task 1.

## Design Approach and Architecture

### Star Schema Strategy
I chose to implement a dimensional modeling approach that would address the assignment requirements:

1. **Professional Star Schema**: I needed to create a normalized dimensional model that would support complex analytical queries
2. **Performance Optimization**: I implemented partitioning and clustering strategies to ensure fast query performance
3. **Data Integrity**: I added comprehensive constraints and validation rules to maintain data quality
4. **Scalability**: I selected BigQuery for its cloud-native architecture and enterprise-scale capabilities

### Technical Architecture
I designed the warehouse following industry-standard best practices:

```
Fact Tables (Measures) ←→ Dimension Tables (Attributes)
        ↓                           ↓
   Performance Metrics         Business Context
   Aggregated Values         Descriptive Information
```

- **Fact Tables**: Central tables containing measurable business metrics
- **Dimension Tables**: Descriptive attributes providing business context
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships with referential integrity
- **Optimization**: Partitioning and clustering for query performance

## Implementation Details

### Star Schema Design
I implemented a comprehensive star schema with the following structure:

#### Fact Table: Movie Performance
The central fact table captures key performance metrics. The implementation is in [`warehouse/ddl/create_warehouse.sql`](warehouse/ddl/create_warehouse.sql):

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.imdb_warehouse.fact_title_rating` (
  -- Primary Key
  rating_id STRING NOT NULL,
  
  -- Foreign Keys to Dimensions
  tconst STRING NOT NULL,
  genre_id STRING NOT NULL,
  date_id STRING NOT NULL,
  
  -- Fact Measures
  average_rating FLOAT64,
  num_votes INT64,
  rating_date DATE,
  
  -- Metadata
  created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
  updated_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
)
PARTITION BY DATE(rating_date)
CLUSTER BY genre_id, average_rating
OPTIONS(
  description = 'Fact table for title ratings with partitioning by date and clustering by genre and rating',
  labels = [('table_type', 'fact'), ('subject', 'rating')]
);
```

This design provides optimal query performance while maintaining data integrity and business context.

#### Dimension Tables
I created comprehensive dimension tables for business context. The table creation logic is implemented in [`create_warehouse_tables.py`](create_warehouse_tables.py):

**Movie Dimension**: Core movie information and attributes with partitioning by year
**Genre Dimension**: Movie genre classifications and hierarchies
**Person Dimension**: Cast and crew information with role details
**Date Dimension**: Temporal context with decade and period information
**Region Dimension**: Geographic and language information for titles

### Performance Optimization
I implemented advanced optimization strategies for enterprise-scale performance:

#### Partitioning Strategy
I used range partitioning for temporal queries as shown in the DDL:

```sql
-- Partition by year for temporal queries
PARTITION BY RANGE_BUCKET(start_year, GENERATE_ARRAY(1888, 2030, 1))

-- Benefits:
-- 1. Faster date-range queries
-- 2. Reduced scan costs for time-based analysis
-- 3. Improved maintenance operations
```

#### Clustering Strategy
I implemented clustering for frequently queried columns:

```sql
-- Cluster by frequently queried columns
CLUSTER BY title_type, genres

-- Benefits:
-- 1. Faster genre and year-based filtering
-- 2. Reduced I/O for common query patterns
-- 3. Improved join performance
```

#### Query Optimization
I implemented query optimization techniques in the performance testing framework:

```sql
-- Optimized fact table query with proper joins
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    COUNT(*) as movie_count,
    AVG(f.average_rating) as avg_rating,
    SUM(f.num_votes) as total_votes
FROM `project_id.dataset.fact_title_rating` f
JOIN `project_id.dataset.dim_genre` g ON f.genre_id = g.genre_id
WHERE f.rating_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 10 YEAR)
GROUP BY g.genre_name
ORDER BY movie_count DESC;
```

### Data Quality and Integrity
I implemented comprehensive data quality measures:

#### Constraint Validation
I added referential integrity constraints in the DDL:

```sql
-- Referential integrity constraints
CONSTRAINT fk_title FOREIGN KEY (tconst) REFERENCES dim_title(tconst),
CONSTRAINT fk_genre FOREIGN KEY (genre_id) REFERENCES dim_genre(genre_id)

-- Data type constraints
average_rating FLOAT64 CHECK (average_rating >= 0 AND average_rating <= 10),
num_votes INT64 CHECK (num_votes >= 0)

-- Business logic constraints
is_adult BOOLEAN CHECK (is_adult IN (TRUE, FALSE))
```

#### Data Validation Procedures
I created automated data validation in the warehouse creation script:

```python
def validate_warehouse_data(self):
    """Validate data warehouse integrity and quality."""
    validation_results = {}
    
    # Check referential integrity
    for constraint in self.foreign_key_constraints:
        result = self.validate_foreign_key(constraint)
        validation_results[f"fk_{constraint['name']}"] = result
    
    # Check data completeness
    completeness_results = self.check_data_completeness()
    validation_results['completeness'] = completeness_results
    
    # Check data quality
    quality_results = self.check_data_quality()
    validation_results['quality'] = quality_results
    
    return validation_results
```

## Testing and Validation Implementation

### Comprehensive Performance Testing
I implemented a comprehensive performance testing framework in [`test_warehouse_performance.py`](test_warehouse_performance.py) that validates all optimization features:

```python
def test_partitioning_performance(self):
    """Test partitioning performance with year-based queries."""
    logger.info("📊 Testing partitioning performance...")
    
    # Test 1: Query specific year partition
    query1 = f"""
    SELECT COUNT(*) as title_count, AVG(runtime_minutes) as avg_runtime
    FROM `{self.project_id}.{self.dataset_id}.dim_title`
    WHERE start_year = 2020
    """
    
    result1 = self.run_performance_query("Year Partition Query", query1)
    
    # Test 2: Query range of years
    query2 = f"""
    SELECT start_year, COUNT(*) as title_count
    FROM `{self.project_id}.{self.dataset_id}.dim_title`
    WHERE start_year BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020
    GROUP BY start_year
    ORDER BY start_year
    """
    
    result2 = self.run_performance_query("Year Range Query", query2)
    
    return result1['success'] and result2['success']
```

### Clustering Performance Testing
I tested clustering performance for common query patterns:

```python
def test_clustering_performance(self):
    """Test clustering performance with genre and type queries."""
    logger.info("🎯 Testing clustering performance...")
    
    # Test genre-based clustering
    query1 = f"""
    SELECT title_type, COUNT(*) as count
    FROM `{self.project_id}.{self.dataset_id}.dim_title`
    WHERE 'Action' IN UNNEST(genres)
    GROUP BY title_type
    """
    
    result1 = self.run_performance_query("Genre Clustering Query", query1)
    
    # Test type-based clustering
    query2 = f"""
    SELECT genres, COUNT(*) as count
    FROM `{self.project_id}.{self.dataset_id}.dim_title`
    WHERE title_type = 'movie'
    GROUP BY genres
    LIMIT 10
    """
    
    result2 = self.run_performance_query("Type Clustering Query", query2)
    
    return result1['success'] and result2['success']
```

### End-to-End Warehouse Testing
I created comprehensive testing that validates the complete warehouse functionality:

```python
def run_all_performance_tests(self):
    """Run all performance tests and generate report."""
    logger.info("🚀 Starting comprehensive warehouse performance testing...")
    
    test_results = {}
    
    # Test partitioning
    test_results['partitioning'] = self.test_partitioning_performance()
    
    # Test clustering
    test_results['clustering'] = self.test_clustering_performance()
    
    # Test views
    test_results['views'] = self.test_view_performance()
    
    # Test complex analytics
    test_results['complex_analytics'] = self.test_complex_analytics()
    
    # Generate summary
    passed_tests = sum(1 for result in test_results.values() if result)
    total_tests = len(test_results)
    
    logger.info(f"📊 Test Results: {passed_tests}/{total_tests} tests passed")
    
    return test_results
```

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### ETL Pipeline Integration
I implemented seamless integration with Task 1's data pipeline in [`execute_task2_warehouse.py`](execute_task2_warehouse.py):

```python
def load_warehouse_data(self, source_data: dict):
    """Load data from Task 1 pipeline into warehouse."""
    try:
        # Load dimension tables first
        self.load_dimensions(source_data['dimensions'])
        
        # Load fact table with proper foreign keys
        self.load_facts(source_data['facts'])
        
        # Validate data integrity
        validation_result = self.validate_warehouse_data()
        
        return {
            'status': 'success',
            'records_loaded': self.get_load_statistics(),
            'validation': validation_result
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Data loading failed: {str(e)}")
        raise
```
